"I mainly focused my attention on my two images therefore I was working heavily in my this.css file.
I was able to accomplish adding a simple spin animation to said images as well as maintaining the sizes while they move.
I added a little more substance to my comments and I've added two more files called Updates (The one your on now) and Self Info.txt."
